# Autonomous Agent Teams Library - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the essential development phases and tasks for building a TypeScript library focused on creating collaborative teams of autonomous AI agents, inspired by CrewAI, with Ollama integration for testing.

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

### Tasks
- [ ] Create configurable autonomous agents with customizable parameters
  - **Validation**: Can instantiate an agent with different parameters (model, temperature, backstory, personnality traits,...) and observe different behaviors
  
- [ ] Connect agents to Ollama for local model testing
  - **Validation**: Agent can send prompts to Ollama with the model 'llama3.2' and receive responses

- [ ] Implement basic prompt construction and response handling
  - **Validation**: Agent can format information into effective prompts and parse structured responses

- [ ] Enable agents to execute simple tasks with clear instructions
  - **Validation**: Agent can follow a sequence of instructions to complete a defined task

- [ ] Enable end-to-end observability on agent behavior
  - **Validation**: Able to visualize a complete trace of the process with prompts, timing, responses,...

### Acceptance Criteria for MVP
- A single agent can be configured and connected to Ollama
- The agent can complete a simple task with predefined instructions
- Basic examples demonstrate the core functionality

## Phase 2: Team Formation

### Tasks
- [ ] Enable grouping multiple agents into a team
  - **Validation**: Can create a team with multiple agents that share context

- [ ] Implement supervisor functionality for team coordination
  - **Validation**: Supervisor can distribute work and evaluate results from team members

- [ ] Create task planning capability to break down complex objectives
  - **Validation**: Planner can take a complex task and create subtasks for different agents

- [ ] Enable basic communication between team members
  - **Validation**: Agents can share information and results with other team members

- [ ] Implement task tracking and status reporting
  - **Validation**: System accurately reports progress and completion status of tasks

### Acceptance Criteria for Team Formation
- Multiple agents can work together as a team
- Complex tasks can be broken down into manageable subtasks
- Information flows effectively between team members
- A supervisor can coordinate team activities and evaluate outputs

## Phase 3: Tools & Capabilities Extension

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a tool framework for extending agent capabilities
  - **Validation**: Can define a new tool and make it available to agents

- [ ] Implement common utility tools (web search, data processing)
  - **Validation**: Agents can use tools to gather information or process data

- [ ] Enable agents to recognize when to use specific tools
  - **Validation**: Agent correctly selects appropriate tools based on the task requirements

- [ ] Add capability for agents to chain tools together for complex operations
  - **Validation**: Agent can use multiple tools in sequence to solve multi-step problems

- [ ] Implement result verification mechanisms
  - **Validation**: System can detect and address potential errors in tool outputs

### Acceptance Criteria for Tools & Capabilities
- Agents can use tools to extend their capabilities
- A basic library of useful tools is available
- Agents can select appropriate tools for different tasks
- Tools can be combined for more complex operations

## Phase 4: Advanced Collaboration

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement cross-team communication protocols
  - **Validation**: Agents from different teams can share information and coordinate

- [ ] Create mechanisms for agents to request and provide assistance
  - **Validation**: Agents recognize when they need help and can request it from appropriate team members

- [ ] Develop conflict resolution strategies for supervisors
  - **Validation**: Supervisor can effectively resolve different approaches or contradictory results

- [ ] Enable dynamic task creation based on discovered information
  - **Validation**: Teams can create new tasks in response to findings or changing requirements

- [ ] Implement parallel task execution for efficiency
  - **Validation**: Multiple non-dependent tasks can be processed simultaneously

### Acceptance Criteria for Advanced Collaboration
- Multiple teams can work together on larger objectives
- Agents proactively seek help when needed
- Conflicts are effectively resolved by supervisors
- Teams adapt to new information by creating appropriate tasks
- System efficiently processes tasks in parallel when possible

## Phase 5: Human Integration & Refinement

### Tasks
- [ ] Implement human-in-the-loop functionality for guidance and feedback
  - **Validation**: System can pause for human input at critical decision points

- [ ] Create agent reflection mechanisms for continuous improvement
  - **Validation**: Agents learn from past experiences and improve performance over time

- [ ] Add state persistence to save and restore agent and team status
  - **Validation**: Work can be suspended and resumed across different sessions

- [ ] Enable performance monitoring and optimization
  - **Validation**: System provides metrics on efficiency and effectiveness of agents and teams

- [ ] Create comprehensive logging for transparency
  - **Validation**: All significant agent actions and decisions are recorded and reviewable

### Acceptance Criteria for Human Integration & Refinement
- Humans can intervene and provide guidance at critical points
- Agents improve based on experience and feedback
- Work can continue across multiple sessions
- System performance can be measured and optimized
- Complete transparency into agent decision-making

## Phase 6: Documentation & Examples

### Tasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
  - **Validation**: Documentation covers all features with clear explanations and examples

- [ ] Develop end-to-end examples for common use cases
  - **Validation**: Examples demonstrate practical applications across different domains

- [ ] Write quickstart guide for new users
  - **Validation**: New users can create a working agent system within 15 minutes

- [ ] Create tutorials for different agent team configurations
  - **Validation**: Tutorials show how to build specialized teams for different purposes

- [ ] Document best practices and patterns
  - **Validation**: Guidelines help users avoid common pitfalls and optimize team design

### Acceptance Criteria for Documentation & Examples
- Documentation is comprehensive and clear
- Examples demonstrate practical applications
- New users can get started quickly
- Tutorials cover a range of common use cases
- Best practices guide helps users design effective agent teams
